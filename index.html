        <h3>Understanding the Data</h3>
        <p>A <strong>Bitcoin Premium</strong> occurs when the local price of Bitcoin is higher than the global market
            price. This often happens in countries with currency instability because:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Capital Controls:</strong> Restrictions on moving money out of the country create a "desperation
                demand" for Bitcoin as an escape hatch.</li>
            <li><strong>Arbitrage Friction:</strong> It is difficult for traders to bring "new" Bitcoin into the country
                to lower the price, keeping premiums high.</li>
            <li><strong>Shadow Rates:</strong> Bitcoin prices often reflect the "true" street value of a currency,
                rather than the official government exchange rate.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="insight-note"><em>Note: A higher premium doesn't always mean more people are using Bitcoin, but it
                often indicates how difficult it is for citizens to access stable value.</em></p>
        <p class="insight-note">
            <strong>💡 Market Tip:</strong> You might notice small spikes when the global price of Bitcoin moves
            rapidly. Because local markets in emerging economies have less "liquidity" (available cash/trading volume),
            they often take a few hours to catch up to global price swings, causing the premium to fluctuate
            temporarily.

            <h4>📈 Spikes Upward</h4>
            <p>Indicates <strong>sudden demand</strong>. Often follows news of currency devaluation or new government
                restrictions on foreign currency (USD) access.</p>

        <div class="takeaway-box down">
            <h4>📉 Spikes Downward</h4>
            <p>Indicates <strong>market cooling</strong>. Usually happens when the government stabilizes the currency or
                new trading routes allow supply to catch up with demand.</p>
